# Reports App

### Based on a university project

Reports is an application written in ```flutter```/```dart``` that allows you to register a user and insert a report that will be saved remotely on Firebase.
It is also possible through an Admin account to manage registered users, block them or delete their reports.

Normal users can view all reports from unblocked users but are only able to delete reports they created themselves.

Each report has an author, a place, a description, a date and the possibility of adding a photo from camera or library.

## Info
Some files such as ```firebase_options.dart``` or ```app_version_control.dart``` are not included or have been modified to hide sensitive information such as apiKeys or tokens.

Check [How ```app_version_control.dart``` works](./how_works_app_version_control.md) for more info.
